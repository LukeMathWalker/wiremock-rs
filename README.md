`wiremock` provides HTTP mocking to perform black-box testing of Rust applications that
interact with third-party APIs.

It provides mocking of HTTP responses using request matching and response templating.

*The name `wiremock` is a reference to [`WireMock.Net`](https://github.com/WireMock-Net/WireMock.Net), a .NET port of the original [`Wiremock`](http://wiremock.org/) from Java.*

## Getting started
```rust
use wiremock::{MockServer, Mock, ResponseTemplate};
use wiremock::matchers::{method, path};

#[async_std::main]
async fn main() {
    // Start a background HTTP server on a random local port
    let mock_server = MockServer::start().await;

    // Arrange the behaviour of the MockServer adding a Mock:
    // when it receives a GET request on '/hello' it will respond with a 200.
    Mock::given(method("GET"))
        .and(path("/hello"))
        .respond_with(ResponseTemplate::new(200))
        // Mounting the mock on the mock server - it's now effective!
        .mount(&mock_server)
        .await;
    
    // If we probe the MockServer using any HTTP client it behaves as expected.
    let status = surf::get(format!("{}/hello", &mock_server.uri()))
        .await
        .unwrap()
        .status();
    assert_eq!(status.as_u16(), 200);

    // If the request doesn't match any `Mock` mounted on our `MockServer` a 404 is returned.
    let status = surf::get(format!("{}/missing", &mock_server.uri()))
        .await
        .unwrap()
        .status();
    assert_eq!(status.as_u16(), 404);
}
```

## Matchers

`wiremock` provides a set of matching strategies out of the box - check the [`matchers`] module
for a complete list.

You can define your own matchers using the [`Match`] trait, as well as using `Fn` closures.  
Check [`Match`]'s documentation for more details and examples.

## Spying 

`wiremock` empowers you to set expectations on the number of invocations to your [`Mock`]s - 
check the [`expect`] method for more details.

Expectations can be used to verify that a side-effect has (or has not) taken place!

Expectations are automatically verified during the shutdown of each [`MockServer`] instance,
at the end of your test. A failed verification will trigger a panic.  
By default, no expectations are set on your [`Mock`]s.

## Test isolation

Each instance of [`MockServer`] is fully isolated: [`start`] takes care of finding a random port
available on your local machine which is assigned to the new [`MockServer`].

You should use one instance of [`MockServer`] for each test, to ensure full isolation and
no cross-test interference.

When a [`MockServer`] instance goes out of scope (e.g. the test finishes), the corresponding
HTTP server running in the background is shut down to free up the port it was using.

## Runtime compatibility

`wiremock` can be used (and it is tested to work) with both [`async_std`] and [`tokio`] as
futures runtimes.  
If you encounter any compatibility bug, please open an issue on our [GitHub repository].

## Prior art

[`mockito`] and [`httpmock`] provide HTTP mocking for Rust.

Check the table below to see how `wiremock` compares to them across the following dimensions:
- Test execution strategy (do tests have to be executed sequentially or can they be executed in parallel?);
- How many APIs can I mock in a test?
- Out-of-the-box request matchers;
- Extensible request matching (i.e. you can define your own matchers);
- Sync/Async API;
- Spying (e.g. verify that a mock has/hasn't been called in a test);
- Standalone mode (i.e. can I launch an HTTP mock server outside of a test suite?).

|           | Test execution strategy | How many APIs can I mock? | Out-of-the-box request matchers | Extensible request maching | API   | Spying | Standalone mode |

## Future evolution

More request matchers can be added to those provided out-of-the-box to handle common usecases.
