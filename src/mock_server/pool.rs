/// ## Design constraints
///
/// `wiremock`'s pooling is designed to be an invisible optimisation: users of the crate, if
/// we are successful, should never have to reason about it.
///
/// ## Motivation
///
/// Why are we pooling `BareMockServer`s?
/// Mostly to reduce the number of `TcpListener`s that are being opened and closed, therefore
/// mitigating risk of our users having to fight/raise OS limits for the maximum number of open
/// connections (e.g. ulimit on Linux).
///
/// It is also marginally faster to get a pooled `BareMockServer` than to create a new one, but
/// the absolute time is so small (<1 ms) that it does not make a material difference in a real
/// world test suite.

    //
    // We might expose in the future a way for a crate user to tune this value.
