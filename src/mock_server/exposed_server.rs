///
/// Each instance of `MockServer` is fully isolated: [`MockServer::start`] takes care of finding a random port

///
/// You can use [`MockServer::builder`] if you need to specify custom configuration - e.g.
/// run on a specific port or disable request recording.
///
/// ## Best practices
///
/// You should use one instance of `MockServer` for each REST API that your application interacts
/// with and needs mocking for testing purposes.
///
/// To ensure full isolation and no cross-test interference, `MockServer`s shouldn't be
/// shared between tests. Instead, `MockServer`s should be created in the test where they are used.
///
/// When using a [`Mock`] within a test helper function, consider using [`MockServer::register_as_scoped`]
/// instead of [`MockServer::register`].
///
/// You can register as many [`Mock`]s as your scenario requires on a `MockServer`.
