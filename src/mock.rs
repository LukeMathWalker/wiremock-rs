    ///   in your application is supposed to trigger a notification;
    /// - check that a 3rd party API is NOT called when the response of a call is expected
    ///   to be retrieved from a cache (`.expect(0)`).

// Implementation notes: this has gone through a couple of iterations before landing to
// what you see now.
//
// The original draft had Times itself as an enum with two variants (Exact and Range), with
// the Range variant generic over `R: RangeBounds<u64>`.
//
// We switched to a generic struct wrapper around a private `R: RangeBounds<u64>` when we realised
// that you would have had to specify a range type when creating the Exact variant
// (e.g. as you do for `Option` when creating a `None` variant).
//
// We achieved the same functionality with a struct wrapper, but exact values had to converted
// to ranges with a single element (e.g. 15 -> 15..16).
// Not the most expressive representation, but we would have lived with it.
//
// We changed once again when we started to update our `MockActor`: we are storing all `Mock`s
// in a vector. Being generic over `R`, the range type leaked into the overall `Mock` (and `MountedMock`)
// type, thus making those generic as well over `R`.
// To store them in a vector all mocks would have had to use the same range internally, which is
// obviously an unreasonable restrictions.
// At the same time, we can't have a Box<dyn RangeBounds<u64>> because `contains` is a generic
// method hence the requirements for object safety are not satisfied.
//
// Thus we ended up creating this master enum that wraps all range variants with the addition
// of the Exact variant.
// If you can do better, please submit a PR.
// We keep them enum private to the crate to allow for future refactoring.
